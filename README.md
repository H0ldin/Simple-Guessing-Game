Hello! This is just a simple test to see how far I can optimize this little guessing game. It's run in python and there is kind of only one file there.
If you have any other suggestions on how it can be optimized let me know and I can implement it and I would also love to see what others think and if they
have any other advice. Thanks for checking it out!
